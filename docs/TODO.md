# Tasker v2.2.1 - Industry Best Practices & Documentation Excellence

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Tasker v2.2.1, focusing on industry-standard best practices and comprehensive documentation improvements. Building on the successful v2.2.0 release, this version will enhance production readiness, developer experience, and documentation quality while maintaining the Unix principle of "do one thing and do it well."

## Status

ðŸŽ¯ **v2.2.1 Development** - IN PROGRESS

**Foundation**: v2.2.0 successfully published with pride!
- âœ… Complete workflow orchestration system
- âœ… Production-ready authentication/authorization
- âœ… 75.18% YARD documentation coverage
- âœ… All 674 tests passing

**Focus**: Polish, best practices, and developer experience excellence

## Phase 1: Industry Best Practices Enhancement

### 1.1 Health Check Endpoints ðŸŽ¯

**Objective**: Provide industry-standard health check endpoints for production deployment

**Scope**: Lightweight endpoints for load balancers, Kubernetes probes, and monitoring systems

**Implementation Plan**:
```ruby
# Routes to add:
GET /tasker/health/ready   # Readiness probe (database connectivity, basic functionality)
GET /tasker/health/live    # Liveness probe (simple response, no dependencies)
GET /tasker/health/status  # Detailed status (for monitoring dashboards)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Readiness endpoint validates database connectivity
- [ ] Readiness endpoint checks critical system components
- [ ] Liveness endpoint provides simple 200 OK response
- [ ] Status endpoint provides detailed system information
- [ ] All endpoints follow Rails conventions and return JSON
- [ ] Endpoints are optimized for low latency (< 100ms)
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all health check scenarios

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `app/controllers/tasker/health_controller.rb`
- `config/routes.rb` (add health routes)
- `lib/tasker/health/readiness_checker.rb`
- `lib/tasker/health/liveness_checker.rb`
- `spec/controllers/tasker/health_controller_spec.rb`

### 1.2 Structured Logging Enhancement ðŸŽ¯

**Objective**: Implement structured logging with correlation IDs and consistent JSON formatting

**Scope**: Concern for consistent log formats across all Tasker components

**Implementation Plan**:
```ruby
# Add structured logging concern
module Tasker::Concerns::StructuredLogging
  # Provides: log_structured, log_with_correlation, log_step_event, log_task_event
end
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Structured logging concern with JSON formatting
- [ ] Correlation ID generation and tracking
- [ ] Consistent log format across all Tasker components
- [ ] Integration with existing event system
- [ ] Configurable log levels and output formats

- [ ] Clear separation: interface in gem, implementation in host app

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `lib/tasker/rate_limiting/interface.rb`
- `lib/tasker/rate_limiting/null_limiter.rb` (default no-op implementation)
- `lib/tasker/concerns/rate_limitable.rb`
- `docs/RATE_LIMITING.md` (integration examples)
- `spec/lib/tasker/rate_limiting/interface_spec.rb`

### 1.4 Enhanced Configuration Validation ðŸŽ¯

**Objective**: Comprehensive startup validation for production readiness

**Scope**: Validate configuration, dependencies, and system requirements at startup

**Implementation Plan**:
```ruby
# Enhanced configuration validation
module Tasker::Configuration::Validator
  # Validates: database connectivity, required gems, security settings, etc.
end
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Database connectivity validation
- [ ] Required dependency validation (gems, classes)
- [ ] Security configuration validation (secrets, algorithms)
- [ ] Performance setting validation (connection pools, timeouts)
- [ ] Clear error messages with resolution guidance
- [ ] Fail-fast behavior on critical configuration errors
- [ ] Environment-specific validation rules

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `lib/tasker/configuration/validator.rb`
