# Roadmap

## 1. **Structured Logging (Gap)**
Currently relies on Rails default logging. A workflow orchestration engine should provide:
- Correlation IDs for tracking workflows across distributed systems
- Structured JSON logging for better observability
- Consistent log formatting across all components
- Performance-optimized logging with minimal overhead

## 2. **Metrics & Performance Monitoring (Gap)**
While events exist, there's no built-in metrics collection:
- Step/task execution duration histograms
- Queue depth and processing rates
- Resource utilization metrics
- SLA tracking and alerting thresholds

## 3. **Advanced Retry Strategies (Enhancement)**
Current exponential backoff is good, but could add:
- Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Bulkhead isolation for resource protection
- Adaptive retry strategies based on error types
- Dead letter queue managementX


## Strategic Plan for Next Steps

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4: Observability Enhancement
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: Critical - Production operations require deep observability

Full implementation plan is in [OBSERVABILITY_ENHANCEMENT.md](./OBSERVABILITY_ENHANCEMENT.md)

#### 4.1 Structured Logging System
```ruby
# Implement correlation ID tracking
module Tasker::Concerns::StructuredLogging
  def log_structured(level, message, **context)
    # Include correlation_id, task_id, step_id, duration
  end
end
```

#### 4.2 Built-in Metrics Collection
```ruby
# Native metrics without external dependencies
module Tasker::Metrics
  class Collector
    # Histogram: task.duration, step.duration
    # Counter: task.completed, task.failed
    # Gauge: queue.depth, active.tasks
  end
end
```

#### 4.3 Performance Profiling
- Automatic slow query detection
- Memory usage tracking per workflow
- Bottleneck identification and reporting

### ðŸ”§ Phase 5: Advanced Orchestration Patterns
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Impact**: High - Expands use cases significantly

#### 5.1 Circuit Breaker Implementation
```ruby
class Tasker::CircuitBreaker
  # Prevents cascade failures
  # Automatic recovery detection
  # Configurable thresholds
end
```

### ðŸ“Š Phase 6: Advanced Analytics
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Impact**: Medium - Enables data-driven optimization

#### 6.1 Workflow Analytics Engine
- Historical performance trends
- Bottleneck prediction
- Resource utilization forecasting
- SLA compliance reporting

#### 6.2 Intelligent Scheduling
- Load-based task scheduling
- Priority queue management
- Resource-aware execution
- Predictive scaling recommendations
