Summary of Step 1.2 Completion

We have successfully implemented **Step 1.2: Create State Machines Using Existing Definitions** with the following components:

### ✅ **What We've Built:**

1. **TaskStateMachine** (`tasker/lib/tasker/state_machine/task_state_machine.rb`)
   - Uses existing task status constants from `Constants::TaskStatuses`
   - Defines proper state transitions based on existing business logic
   - Integrates with lifecycle events through callbacks
   - Includes guard clauses for transition validation

2. **StepStateMachine** (`tasker/lib/tasker/state_machine/step_state_machine.rb`)
   - Uses existing step status constants from `Constants::WorkflowStepStatuses`
   - Handles step dependencies and transition validation
   - Fires appropriate lifecycle events for step state changes
   - Includes guard clauses for dependency checking

3. **Compatibility Module** (`tasker/lib/tasker/state_machine/compatibility.rb`)
   - Preserves existing `update_status!` and `status=` API
   - Provides convenience methods like `pending?`, `in_progress?`, etc.
   - Automatically detects whether entity is a Task or WorkflowStep
   - Handles error conditions gracefully

4. **Main State Machine Module** (`tasker/lib/tasker/state_machine.rb`)
   - Provides factory methods for creating state machines
   - Offers utility methods for state transitions
   - Includes configuration checking and statistics

5. **Model Integration**
   - Updated `Task` and `WorkflowStep` models to use state machines
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
   - Added state machine getter methods

6. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Tests for all state machine classes and functionality
   - Tests for compatibility layer
   - Tests for edge cases and error handling
   - All 24 test examples passing

### ✅ **Key Features Implemented:**

- **Declarative State Management**: States and transitions are now defined declaratively using Statesman
- **Event Integration**: State changes automatically fire lifecycle events
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
- **Validation**: Guard clauses prevent invalid state transitions
- **Audit Trail**: Ready for transition history tracking (via existing transition models)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid transitions and missing dependencies

### ✅ **Integration Points:**

- Uses existing `Constants` for state definitions
- Integrates with existing `LifecycleEvents` system
- Works with existing `TaskTransition` and `WorkflowStepTransition` models
- Preserves existing model APIs and method signatures

The foundation is now in place for the declarative event-driven architecture. The next step would be **Phase 2: Event-Driven Workflow Orchestration**, where we can build publisher/subscriber components that use these state machines to orchestrate workflow execution.

✅ What We Now Have:**

1. **Proper Statesman transition tables** with all required columns:
   - `to_state` - The target state for each transition
   - `metadata` - JSONB field for storing transition context
   - `sort_key` - For ordering transitions chronologically
   - Foreign key references to parent entities
   - Proper indexes for performance and uniqueness

2. **Complete database schema** that supports our state machine implementation

3. **All tests passing** (24/24) confirming our implementation works with the database

4. **Clean codebase** with no conflicting state machine directories

**Step 1.2 is now fully complete with proper database support!**

Our state machine infrastructure is ready to handle:
- Transition history tracking
- Audit trails with metadata
- Conflict prevention through unique constraints
- Performance optimization through proper indexing
