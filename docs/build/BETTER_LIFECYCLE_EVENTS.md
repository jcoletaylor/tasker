## 🚨 **IDENTIFIED OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY: Event Publishing Noise & Helper Consolidation**

### **Current Issue: Verbose Event Publishing Patterns**

**Problem Identified**: While our event system is functionally complete, the user has noted that our `publish_event` mechanisms create noise and we had previously built more specific helpers for different event types with nuanced payloads.

**Current State Analysis**:
- ✅ **EventPublisher Concern**: Provides clean `publish_event()`, `publish_step_event()`, `publish_task_event()` methods
- ✅ **EventPayloadBuilder**: Standardizes payload creation with event type specialization
- ✅ **Publisher Class**: Has convenience methods like `publish_task_started()`, `publish_step_completed()`
- ⚠️ **Noise Issue**: Multiple ways to publish same events, inline payload building still happening

**Examples of Current Noise**:
```ruby
# Multiple patterns exist for same outcome:
publish_event(event_name, EventPayloadBuilder.build_step_payload(step, task, event_type: :completed))
publish_step_event(event_name, step, event_type: :completed)
publisher.publish_step_completed(payload)
```

### **Proposed Next Phase: Event Publishing API Consolidation**

**Phase 4: Clean Event Publishing Interface (UPCOMING):**

1. **🔄 Consolidate Event Publishing Methods** - Single Clean API
   - **Goal**: Reduce API surface area and eliminate redundant publishing patterns
   - **Approach**: Keep the most intuitive methods, deprecate duplicates
   - **Target**: Single method per event category with smart defaults

2. **🔄 Enhanced Domain-Specific Helpers** - Context-Aware Publishing
   - **Step Events**: `publish_step_started()`, `publish_step_completed()`, `publish_step_failed()` with automatic payload building
   - **Task Events**: `publish_task_started()`, `publish_task_completed()` with completion statistics
   - **Orchestration Events**: `publish_steps_discovered()`, `publish_workflow_completed()` with context inference

3. **🔄 Inline Payload Building Elimination** - Zero Manual Payload Construction
   - **Goal**: Remove all manual `EventPayloadBuilder.build_*` calls from application code
   - **Approach**: Embed payload building logic inside domain-specific helpers
   - **Benefit**: Cleaner calling code, consistent payloads, reduced cognitive overhead

4. **🔄 Event Type Inference** - Smart Defaults Based on Context
   - **Goal**: Automatically determine event type from method context
   - **Example**: `publish_step_event(step)` in error handler automatically knows it's a `:failed` event
   - **Approach**: Use caller context or step/task state to infer event type

**Target API Design**:
```ruby
# CURRENT (noisy)
publish_step_event(
  Tasker::Constants::StepEvents::COMPLETED,
  step,
  event_type: :completed,
  additional_context: { retry_count: 3 }
)

# TARGET (clean)
publish_step_completed(step, retry_count: 3)  # Auto-builds payload, infers event type
```

- **`spec/mocks`** ✅ **9/9 tests** - Mock infrastructure working
- **`spec/factories_spec.rb`** ✅ **26/26 tests** - Factory system functioning properly

**Key Finding**: **Core functionality is working** - the event consolidation did not break the fundamental data models, API layer, job processing, or factory infrastructure.

#### **❌ FAILING TEST SUITES (Integration Issues)**

### **1. Core Library Tests: `spec/lib/tasker` (15 failures out of 141 tests)**

**Status**: **126/141 tests passing** - Core functionality works but event integration has issues

#### **Issue 1A: Event Name Mismatches**
```ruby
# Expected vs Actual Event Names:
Expected: "tasker.task.start_requested"
Actual:   "tasker.metric.tasker.task.started"

Expected: "tasker.step.handle"
Actual:   "tasker.metric.tasker.step.processing"
```
**Root Cause**: Tests expect old event names but instrumentation is firing new consolidated names.

#### **Issue 1B: LifecycleEvents Bridge Broken**
```ruby
# Tests expecting ActiveSupport::Notifications events but getting 0 events
expect(captured_events.size).to eq(1)  # Got 0
```
**Root Cause**: `Tasker::LifecycleEvents.fire()` may not be properly bridging to ActiveSupport::Notifications after consolidation.

#### **Issue 1C: Missing State Machine Methods**
```ruby
# Error: Tasker::StateMachine::TaskStateMachine does not implement: transition_to!
expect(Tasker::StateMachine::TaskStateMachine).to receive(:transition_to!)
```
**Root Cause**: Class-level `transition_to!` methods missing from state machine classes.

#### **Issue 1D: Missing Compatibility Module**
```ruby
# Error: undefined constant Tasker::StateMachine::Compatibility
expect(defined?(Tasker::StateMachine::Compatibility)).to be_truthy
```

**Failed Test Files**:
- `spec/lib/tasker/instrumentation_spec.rb` (6 failures) - Event naming and OpenTelemetry integration
- `spec/lib/tasker/lifecycle_events_spec.rb` (4 failures) - ActiveSupport::Notifications bridge
- `spec/lib/tasker/state_machine_spec.rb` (5 failures) - Missing class methods and compatibility module

### **2. GraphQL Tests: `spec/graphql/tasker` (3 failures out of 11 tests)**

**Status**: **8/11 tests passing** - GraphQL queries work but step workflow tests fail

#### **Issue 2A: Invalid State Transition**
```ruby
# Error: Cannot transition from 'pending' to 'pending'
Statesman::TransitionFailedError: Cannot transition from 'pending' to 'pending'
```
**Location**: `lib/tasker/task_handler/instance_methods.rb:527` in `blocked_by_errors?` method
**Root Cause**: State machine trying to transition task back to 'pending' when already in 'pending' state.

**Failed Test Files**:
- `spec/graphql/tasker/workflow_step_spec.rb` (3 failures) - All workflow step-related GraphQL operations failing due to state machine transition issue

### **3. Task Integration Tests: `spec/tasks` (1 failure out of 19 tests)**

**Status**: **18/19 tests passing** - API task examples work but complete workflow fails

#### **Issue 3A: Test Isolation - Step Name Conflicts**
```ruby
# Error: Step name 'fetch_cart' must be unique within the same task
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Step name 'fetch_cart' must be unique within the same task
```
**Location**: `app/models/tasker/workflow_step.rb:207` in `build_default_step!`
**Root Cause**: Test isolation issue where multiple tests create steps with same names in shared contexts.

**Failed Test Files**:
- `spec/tasks/integration_example_spec.rb` (1 failure) - Complete workflow test failing due to step name uniqueness

### **4. Workflow Orchestration Examples: `spec/examples` (6 failures out of 13 tests)**

**Status**: **7/13 tests passing** - System initialization works but event-driven workflow processing fails

#### **Issue 4A: StepSequence Type Error**
```ruby
# Error: Invalid type for :steps violates constraints (type?(Array, ActiveRecord::AssociationRelation))
Dry::Struct::Error: [Tasker::Types::StepSequence.new] ActiveRecord::AssociationRelation has invalid type for :steps
```
**Location**: `lib/tasker/orchestration/viable_step_discovery.rb:114` in `get_sequence`
**Root Cause**: StepSequence expects Array but getting ActiveRecord::AssociationRelation

#### **Issue 4B: Event System Not Firing**
```ruby
# Tests expecting events but getting empty arrays
expect(fired_events).not_to be_empty    # Got []
expect(orchestration_events).not_to be_empty  # Got []
expect(monitoring_events).not_to be_empty     # Got []
```
**Root Cause**: Event-driven workflow orchestration not firing events as expected in new architecture.

**Failed Test Files**:
- `spec/examples/workflow_orchestration_example_spec.rb` (6 failures) - All event-driven workflow processing tests failing

---

### **🎯 CRITICAL ISSUES SUMMARY**

#### **Priority 1: State Machine Integration**
1. **Invalid State Transitions**: Fix `blocked_by_errors?` method trying to transition 'pending' → 'pending'
2. **Missing Class Methods**: Implement `transition_to!` class methods on state machine classes

- `lib/tasker/state_machine/*.rb` (missing methods and compatibility)
- `lib/tasker/orchestration/viable_step_discovery.rb` (type conversion)
- Test files with event name expectations (multiple files)

**Test Coverage Status**: **Core functionality 100% working** (models, requests, jobs, routing, factories) with **integration layer issues** requiring focused fixes.

---

#### **🎉 Key Final Achievements:**

- ✅ **100% Success Rate**: All 337+ tests migrated successfully across 4 phases
- ✅ **Zero Infrastructure Issues**: All deadlocks, conflicts, and validation failures resolved
- ✅ **Real Integration Testing**: Factory approach catches actual system issues vs. mocks
- ✅ **Event System Validation**: State machine and lifecycle events properly tested with real objects
- ✅ **Enhanced Coverage**: Line coverage increased to 66.95% with comprehensive workflow testing

#### **🛠 Critical Infrastructure Fixes Applied in Phase 4:**
- **Factory Context Validation**: Added required `context` attributes to all factories (resolved 60+ test failures)
- **Missing Factory Traits**: Implemented `:with_workflow_steps` and enhanced `:api_integration` traits
- **Test Isolation**: Fixed TaskDiagram step name conflicts and improved test independence
- **Find-or-Create Patterns**: Eliminated database constraint violations across all factories

#### **🚀 Event System Foundation Ready:**
With 100% factory-based testing complete, the system now has a **rock-solid foundation** for the advanced event-driven architecture transformation outlined below, with:
- **State machine transitions properly validated** with real workflow objects
- **Event payload testing** with factory-created scenarios
- **Lifecycle event integration** tested across all workflow types
- **Real integration coverage** for event-driven orchestration implementation

*Detailed results and implementation specifics available in `FACTORY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`*

### **🔧 Critical Event System Fix Applied**

#### **Issue Discovered & Resolved:**
**Problem**: `"Subscriber Class does not implement .subscribe method"` warning during test execution

**Root Cause**: Event bus `subscribe_object()` method incorrectly called `.class` on class parameter instead of handling class directly

**Solution Applied**: Fixed `lib/tasker/events/bus.rb` line 37-45:
```ruby
# OLD (incorrect):
def subscribe_object(subscriber)
  subscriber_class = subscriber.class  # Bug: already a class!
  if subscriber_class.respond_to?(:subscribe)

# NEW (correct):
def subscribe_object(subscriber)
  if subscriber.respond_to?(:subscribe)  # subscriber IS the class
```

**Result**: ✅ Warning eliminated, `TelemetrySubscriber` now properly subscribes to events

### **🚨 Instrumentation System Gaps Identified**

During factory migration testing, we discovered several **instrumentation infrastructure gaps** that need to be addressed:

#### **Issue #1: Missing Instrumentation Interface**
```
Failed to record telemetry metric step.started: undefined method `record_event' for Tasker::Instrumentation:Module
```

**Impact**: Telemetry system unable to record metrics
**Required Action**: Implement `Tasker::Instrumentation.record_event` method or interface
**Priority**: Medium (doesn't affect core functionality)

#### **Issue #2: Incomplete Event Payload Standardization**
```
Error firing lifecycle event step.completed: key not found: :execution_duration
Error firing state machine event step.completed: key not found: :execution_duration
Error firing lifecycle event step.failed: key not found: :error_message
```

**Impact**: Event subscribers expecting standardized payload keys that aren't being provided
**Required Action**: Standardize event payload structure across all event publishers
**Priority**: Medium (telemetry/observability concern)

#### **Issue #3: Event Payload Schema Mismatches**
**Current State**:
- Events being fired with inconsistent payload structures
- `TelemetrySubscriber` expects specific keys (`:execution_duration`, `:error_message`, `:attempt_number`)
- Event publishers not providing these keys consistently

**Required Solution**:
```ruby
# Need to standardize event payload structure like:
{
  # Core identifiers (always present)
  task_id: task.id,
  step_id: step&.id,

  # Timing information (when available)
  started_at: timestamp,
  completed_at: timestamp,
  execution_duration: duration_seconds,

  # Error information (for error events)
  error_message: exception.message,
  exception_class: exception.class.name,
  attempt_number: step.attempts,

  # Context (when relevant)
  step_name: step.name,
  task_name: task.named_task.name
}
```

### **📋 Action Items for Event System Completion**

#### **Immediate (High Priority)**
- [ ] **Continue Phase 3**: Request/Controller test migration (factory patterns proven successful)
- [ ] **Document Event Patterns**: Update factory helpers with event integration examples

#### **Infrastructure Enhancement (Medium Priority)**
- [ ] **Implement Missing Instrumentation Interface**:
  ```ruby
  module Tasker::Instrumentation
    def self.record_event(metric_name, attributes = {})
      # Implement telemetry recording logic
      # Could integrate with OpenTelemetry, StatsD, etc.
    end
  end
  ```

- [ ] **Standardize Event Payload Structure**:
  - Create `EventPayloadBuilder` class for consistent payload creation
  - Update all event publishers to use standardized payloads
  - Add payload validation/schema enforcement

- [ ] **Enhance TelemetrySubscriber Resilience**:
  - Add defensive key checking in event handlers
  - Provide fallback values for missing payload keys
  - Improve error handling in telemetry recording

#### **Future Enhancement (Low Priority)**
- [ ] **Event Schema Validation**: Implement runtime payload validation
- [ ] **Event Versioning**: Add payload versioning for backward compatibility
- [ ] **Enhanced Telemetry**: Extend instrumentation with more sophisticated metrics

### **🎯 Next Steps: Continue Factory Migration Success**

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Phase 3 (Request/Controller Tests)** since:
1. ✅ Factory patterns proven highly effective for complex integration scenarios
2. ✅ Event system properly connected and functioning
3. ✅ Infrastructure gaps identified but don't block core functionality
4. ✅ Foundation solid for continued migration

**Target for Phase 3**:
- `spec/requests/tasker/tasks_spec.rb` (242 lines, OpenAPI/Swagger integration)
- `spec/requests/tasker/workflow_steps_spec.rb` (Workflow step API testing)
- `spec/requests/tasker/task_diagrams_spec.rb` (Task diagram generation testing)
- `spec/jobs/tasker/task_runner_job_spec.rb` (Critical job execution testing)

## Preamble: Current State Analysis and Transformation Strategy

### Current Implementation Deep Dive

The Tasker system has evolved into a sophisticated workflow engine with impressive event infrastructure, but it suffers from a fundamental architectural tension: **robust event definitions paired with imperative workflow execution**.

#### Existing Event Infrastructure (Sophisticated but Underutilized)

The system already contains remarkable event infrastructure that's currently underutilized:

**Event Definition System**:
- `EventDefinition` class with factory methods for task/step/workflow/telemetry events
- `EventRegistry` singleton managing 20+ predefined events with validation
- `StateTransition` class with predefined TASK_TRANSITIONS and STEP_TRANSITIONS
- `EventSchema` with dry-validation contracts for payload validation
- Comprehensive event categorization and metadata support

**Current Event Usage Pattern**:
- Events fired via `Tasker::LifecycleEvents.fire()` using ActiveSupport::Notifications
- Primary purpose: observational telemetry and instrumentation
- Events report what happened, but don't control what happens next
- 15+ event firing points throughout TaskHandler::InstanceMethods

#### The Imperative Workflow Problem

The core workflow logic in `TaskHandler::InstanceMethods` is entirely imperative:

**Main Processing Loop** (`handle` method):
```ruby
loop do
  task.reload
  sequence = get_sequence(task)
  viable_steps = find_viable_steps(task, sequence)
  break if viable_steps.empty?
  processed_steps = handle_viable_steps(task, sequence, viable_steps)
  break if blocked_by_errors?(task, sequence, processed_steps)
end
finalize(task, final_sequence, all_processed_steps)
```

**State Management Issues**:
- Direct `task.update!({ status: CONSTANT })` calls throughout codebase
- No audit trail of state changes or transition reasons
- Race conditions possible with concurrent task processing
- Complex error handling and retry logic scattered across methods
- Finalization logic with multiple re-enqueue scenarios hard to follow

**Step Processing Complexity**:
- `handle_one_step` method contains complex error handling, retry logic, and state updates
- Concurrent vs sequential processing branches with different error handling
- DAG traversal logic mixed with execution logic in `find_viable_steps`

#### Existing Event Registry Capabilities (Ready for Activation)

The system already defines comprehensive state transitions that are perfect for Statesman:

**Predefined Task Transitions**:
- `nil → pending` (task.initialize_requested)
- `pending → in_progress` (task.start_requested)
- `in_progress → complete` (task.completed)
- `in_progress → error` (task.failed)
- `error → pending` (task.retry_requested)

**Predefined Step Transitions**:
- `nil → pending` (step.initialize_requested)
- `pending → in_progress` (step.execution_requested)
- `in_progress → complete` (step.completed)
- `in_progress → error` (step.failed)
- `error → pending` (step.retry_requested)

### Desired Future State: Declarative Event-Driven Architecture

Transform the system to use **events as the primary drivers** of workflow execution:

1. **Statesman State Machines**: Replace direct status updates with state machine transitions
2. **Event-Driven Orchestration**: Workflow logic triggered by state transition events
3. **Publisher/Subscriber Pattern**: Decouple workflow orchestration from state management
4. **Unified Event System**: Single event bus handling both state transitions and orchestration
5. **Declarative Workflow Definition**: Steps declare what events they respond to, not imperative sequencing

#### Target Architecture Components

**State Layer** (Statesman):
- TaskStateMachine and StepStateMachine with database-backed transitions
- Automatic audit trail with transition metadata
- Race condition resolution at database level

**Orchestration Layer** (Dry::Events):
- WorkflowOrchestrator subscribes to state transition events
- Publishes orchestration events (viable_steps_discovered, batch_ready, etc.)
- StepExecutor subscribes to orchestration events and triggers state transitions

**Integration Layer**:
- EventRegistry coordinates both Statesman and dry-events
- Unified event validation and schema enforcement
- Telemetry integration for both state and orchestration events

## Implementation Strategy: Phased Transformation

### Phase 1: Statesman Foundation with Existing Event Integration

#### Step 1.1: State Machine Infrastructure ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE - Statesman gem already in tasker.gemspec

#### Step 1.2: Create State Machines Using Existing Definitions

**Goal**: Implement Statesman state machines using the predefined transitions from EventRegistry.

**Key Implementation**: Leverage existing `StateTransition::TASK_TRANSITIONS` and `StateTransition::STEP_TRANSITIONS`:

**Files to Create**:
```
lib/tasker/state_machines/
  ├── task_state_machine.rb
  ├── step_state_machine.rb
  └── base_state_machine.rb
app/models/
  ├── task_transition.rb
  └── workflow_step_transition.rb
db/migrate/
  ├── xxx_create_task_transitions.rb
  └── xxx_create_workflow_step_transitions.rb
```

**TaskStateMachine Implementation**:
```ruby
class TaskStateMachine < Tasker::StateMachines::BaseStateMachine
  # Use existing Constants for states
  state Constants::TaskStatuses::PENDING, initial: true
  state Constants::TaskStatuses::IN_PROGRESS
  state Constants::TaskStatuses::COMPLETE
  state Constants::TaskStatuses::ERROR
  state Constants::TaskStatuses::CANCELLED
  state Constants::TaskStatuses::RESOLVED_MANUALLY

  # Import transitions from existing StateTransition definitions
  StateTransition::TASK_TRANSITIONS.each do |transition|
    transition from: transition.from_state&.to_sym,
               to: transition.to_state.to_sym
  end

  # Integration hooks for event system
  after_transition do |task, transition, metadata|
    # Fire corresponding lifecycle event
    event_name = determine_event_name(transition)
    EventRegistry.instance.fire_transition_event(event_name, task, transition, metadata)
  end
end
```

**Model Integration**:
```ruby
# app/models/task.rb (updates)
class Task < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :task_transitions, autosave: false, dependent: :destroy

  include Statesman::Adapters::ActiveRecordQueries[
    transition_class: TaskTransition,
    initial_state: Constants::TaskStatuses::PENDING
  ]

  def state_machine
    @state_machine ||= TaskStateMachine.new(
      self,
      transition_class: TaskTransition,
      association_name: :task_transitions
    )
  end

  # Compatibility method for existing code
  def status
    state_machine.current_state
  end

  # Deprecate direct status updates
  def status=(new_status)
    Rails.logger.warn "Direct status assignment deprecated. Use state machine transitions."
    state_machine.transition_to!(new_status)
  end
end
```

#### Step 1.3: Hybrid State Management (Preserve Existing API)

**Goal**: Replace direct status updates while maintaining existing API compatibility.

**Migration Strategy**:
- Keep existing `status` columns during transition period
- Add compatibility layer that delegates to state machine
- Gradually migrate all direct `update!({ status: ... })` calls
- Create data migration for existing records

**Compatibility Layer**:
```ruby
module Tasker::StateMachine::Compatibility
  def update_status!(new_status, metadata = {})
    # New way: use state machine
    state_machine.transition_to!(new_status, metadata)

    # Compatibility: also update status column until migration complete
    update_columns(status: new_status) if respond_to?(:update_columns)
  end
end
```

### Phase 2: Event-Driven Workflow Orchestration

#### Step 2.1: Publisher/Subscriber Architecture

**Goal**: Transform imperative workflow logic into event-driven orchestration.

**New Architecture Components**:

**WorkflowOrchestrator** (Subscriber):
```ruby
class Tasker::WorkflowOrchestrator
  include Dry::Events::Publisher[:workflow]

  # Subscribe to state transition events
  def self.subscribe_to_state_events
    EventRegistry.instance.subscribe('task.state_changed') do |event|
      new.handle_task_state_change(event)
    end

    EventRegistry.instance.subscribe('step.state_changed') do |event|
      new.handle_step_state_change(event)
    end
  end

  def handle_task_state_change(event)
    case event[:new_state]
    when Constants::TaskStatuses::IN_PROGRESS
      publish('workflow.task_started', task_id: event[:task_id])
    when Constants::TaskStatuses::COMPLETE
      publish('workflow.task_completed', task_id: event[:task_id])
    end
  end

  def handle_step_state_change(event)
    case event[:new_state]
    when Constants::WorkflowStepStatuses::COMPLETE
      # Trigger viable step discovery
      publish('workflow.step_completed', {
        task_id: event[:task_id],
        step_id: event[:step_id]
      })
    end
  end
end
```

**ViableStepDiscovery** (Subscriber):
```ruby
class Tasker::ViableStepDiscovery
  include Dry::Events::Publisher[:workflow]

  def self.subscribe_to_orchestration_events
    WorkflowOrchestrator.subscribe('workflow.step_completed') do |event|
      new.discover_viable_steps(event[:task_id])
    end

    WorkflowOrchestrator.subscribe('workflow.task_started') do |event|
      new.discover_viable_steps(event[:task_id])
    end
  end

  def discover_viable_steps(task_id)
    task = Task.find(task_id)
    sequence = get_sequence(task) # Extract from TaskHandler
    viable_steps = find_viable_steps(task, sequence) # Extract from TaskHandler

    if viable_steps.any?
      publish('workflow.viable_steps_discovered', {
        task_id: task_id,
        step_ids: viable_steps.map(&:id),
        processing_mode: determine_processing_mode(task)
      })
    else
      publish('workflow.no_viable_steps', { task_id: task_id })
    end
  end
end
```

**StepExecutor** (Subscriber):
```ruby
class Tasker::StepExecutor
  def self.subscribe_to_workflow_events
    ViableStepDiscovery.subscribe('workflow.viable_steps_discovered') do |event|
      new.execute_steps(event)
    end
  end

  def execute_steps(event)
    steps = WorkflowStep.where(id: event[:step_ids])

    case event[:processing_mode]
    when 'concurrent'
      execute_steps_concurrently(steps)
    when 'sequential'
      execute_steps_sequentially(steps)
    end
  end

  private

  def execute_steps_concurrently(steps)
    futures = steps.map do |step|
      Concurrent::Future.execute { execute_single_step(step) }
    end

    futures.each(&:wait)
  end

  def execute_single_step(step)
    # Trigger state transition instead of direct execution
    step.state_machine.transition_to!(:in_progress, {
      triggered_by: 'workflow.viable_steps_discovered',
      executor: 'StepExecutor'
    })
  end
end
```

#### Step 2.2: Extract Core Workflow Logic

**Goal**: Extract the complex imperative logic from TaskHandler::InstanceMethods into event subscribers.

**Current Imperative Methods to Transform**:

1. **`handle` method main loop** → `WorkflowOrchestrator` event flow
2. **`find_viable_steps`** → `ViableStepDiscovery.discover_viable_steps`
3. **`handle_viable_steps`

## 🎯 **IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITY: Developer-Friendly Event Subscription System**

### **Current Challenge: Hidden Event System with Poor Developer Experience**

**Problem Identified**: While we have a comprehensive and powerful event system, the developer experience for understanding and subscribing to events is severely lacking. Developers using the Tasker Rails engine face significant barriers to leveraging our event infrastructure.

**Current State Analysis**:
- ✅ **Sophisticated Event System**: 50+ events across task, step, workflow, and orchestration categories
- ✅ **Robust Infrastructure**: Events::Publisher, EventPayloadBuilder, standardized payloads
- ⚠️ **Poor Discoverability**: Events only documented as constants, no descriptions or examples
- ⚠️ **No Subscription API**: No clean way to create custom event subscribers
- ⚠️ **Hard-coded TelemetrySubscriber**: Single subscriber implementation, no generalized pattern
- ⚠️ **No Configuration Support**: Cannot specify event subscriptions in YAML task configurations

**Current Developer Pain Points**:
```ruby
# Developers currently face these challenges:

# 1. Event Discovery - How do I know what events exist?
Tasker::Constants::StepEvents::COMPLETED  # What does this event contain?
Tasker::Constants::TaskEvents::FAILED     # When is this fired? What's the payload?

# 2. Subscription - How do I listen to events?
# No clear pattern - must study TelemetrySubscriber implementation

# 3. Custom Subscribers - How do I create my own?
# No base class or pattern to follow

# 4. Configuration - How do I configure subscriptions per task?
# No YAML support for event subscriptions
```

### **Proposed Next Phase: Developer-Friendly Event Subscription System**

**Phase 5: Event Subscription Developer Experience (UPCOMING):**

1. **🔄 Event Documentation & Discovery** - Comprehensive Event Catalog
   - **Goal**: Make all events discoverable with descriptions, payload schemas, and usage examples
   - **Approach**: Create event documentation system with runtime introspection
   - **Deliverable**: Event catalog that developers can browse and understand

2. **🔄 Generalized Subscriber Pattern** - BaseSubscriber Infrastructure
   - **Goal**: Provide clean base class and patterns for creating custom event subscribers
   - **Approach**: Extract common patterns from TelemetrySubscriber into reusable base class
   - **Target**: `class MySubscriber < Tasker::Events::BaseSubscriber` pattern

3. **🔄 Declarative Event Registration** - Simple Subscription API
   - **Goal**: Clean, declarative way to register event handlers
   - **Approach**: Method-based registration with automatic payload handling
   - **Target**: `subscribe_to :step_completed, :task_failed` with automatic method routing

4. **🔄 YAML Configuration Support** - Event Subscription Configuration Files
   - **Goal**: Configure event subscriptions and subscriber classes in dedicated YAML files
   - **Approach**: Create separate event subscription configuration system alongside existing task handler configs
   - **Benefit**: Clean separation between workflow definition and event handling configuration

#### **Target Developer Experience Design**

**Event Discovery**:
```ruby
# Developers can browse and understand events
Tasker::Events.catalog
# => {
#   "step.completed" => {
#     description: "Fired when a workflow step completes successfully",
#     payload_schema: { task_id: String, step_id: String, execution_duration: Float },
#     example: { task_id: "abc123", step_id: "step_1", execution_duration: 2.34 },
#     fired_by: ["StepExecutor", "StepHandler::Api"]
#   }
# }
```

**Simple Subscriber Creation**:
```ruby
# Clean pattern for creating custom subscribers
class OrderNotificationSubscriber < Tasker::Events::BaseSubscriber
  # Declarative subscription registration
  subscribe_to :task_completed, :step_failed

  # Automatic method routing based on event names
  def handle_task_completed(event_name, payload)
    # Send order completion notification
    OrderMailer.completion_email(payload[:task_id]).deliver_later
  end

  def handle_step_failed(event_name, payload)
    # Alert on critical step failures
    AlertService.notify("Step failed: #{payload[:step_name]}")
  end
end
```

**YAML Configuration Support**:
```yaml
# config/tasker/events/order_subscriptions.yaml - Event subscription configuration
---
event_subscriptions:
  - subscriber_class: OrderNotificationSubscriber
    events:
      - task.completed
      - step.failed
    config:
      notification_email: orders@company.com
      alert_threshold: 3_failures_per_hour

  - subscriber_class: MetricsCollectorSubscriber
    events:
      - step.completed
      - task.started
    config:
      metrics_backend: datadog
      namespace: tasker.orders
```

**Task Handler YAML (separate file)**:
```yaml
# config/tasker/tasks/order_process.yaml - Task handler configuration
---
name: order_process
task_handler_class: OrderProcess

step_templates:
  # ... existing step configuration
```

#### **Implementation Strategy**

**Step 5.1: Event Documentation System (Week 1)**
```ruby
# Create event catalog with introspection
module Tasker::Events
  class Catalog
    def self.events
      # Automatically discover events from constants and subscribers
      # Generate payload schemas from EventPayloadBuilder
      # Provide usage examples and descriptions
    end
  end
end
```

**Step 5.2: BaseSubscriber Pattern (Week 1-2)**
```ruby
# Extract common patterns from TelemetrySubscriber
class Tasker::Events::BaseSubscriber
  class_attribute :subscribed_events

  def self.subscribe_to(*events)
    self.subscribed_events = events
    events.each { |event| register_event_handler(event) }
  end

  def self.register_event_handler(event_name)
    # Automatic method routing: :step_completed -> #handle_step_completed
    # Payload validation and error handling
    # Integration with Events::Publisher
  end
end
```

**Step 5.3: YAML Configuration Integration (Week 2)**
```ruby
# Create separate event subscription configuration loader
module Tasker::Events
  class SubscriptionLoader
    def load_subscriptions(config_directory = 'config/tasker/events')
      # Parse YAML event subscription files
      # Instantiate subscriber classes with configuration
      # Register with Events::Publisher during application initialization
    end
  end
end
```

**Step 5.4: Documentation & Examples (Week 2-3)**
- Developer guides for creating custom subscribers
- Event payload reference documentation
- YAML configuration examples
- Integration examples with common use cases

### **Expected Benefits of Phase 5**

1. **Developer Adoption**: Easy event subscription encourages usage of Tasker's observability
2. **Extensibility**: Custom business logic can easily hook into workflow events
3. **Configuration Flexibility**: Different tasks can have different event handling needs
4. **Maintainability**: Standardized subscriber patterns reduce custom implementation variance
5. **Documentation**: Self-documenting event system with examples and schemas
6. **Ecosystem Growth**: Third-party subscribers become possible and documented

### **Phase 5 Success Criteria**

- [ ] **Event Catalog**: Complete documentation of all events with payload schemas and examples
- [ ] **BaseSubscriber Pattern**: Clean base class with declarative subscription API
- [ ] **Automatic Method Routing**: `subscribe_to :step_completed` → `#handle_step_completed`
- [ ] **YAML Configuration**: Task-level event subscription configuration working
- [ ] **TelemetrySubscriber Migration**: Existing TelemetrySubscriber uses new BaseSubscriber pattern
- [ ] **Developer Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for creating and configuring subscribers
- [ ] **Example Implementations**: Common use case examples (notifications, metrics, alerts)
- [ ] **All Tests Passing**: 320+ tests continue passing with enhanced subscription system

**Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 weeks for complete developer-friendly event subscription system
