# TODO

* ~~Add necessary CRUD to GraphQL~~
* Add TasksByAnnotation to the GraphQL Query Resolvers
* Decide if we will allow Cancelling and Updating Tasks and Steps that are Complete or Errored
* Update RSwag / Swagger and mount it to `{root}/api-docs`
* Expose configuration options for which application controller to inherit from (so you can set up auth if desired)
* Build more real-world examples of `Tasker::TaskHandler` implementations
