# Memory Bank Archive

This directory contains historical development notes from when using Cursor/Cline.

**Migration Status**: Key architectural patterns and current progress have been migrated to `CLAUDE.md` for use with Claude Code.

## Claude Code Integration

Claude Code provides better plan-act patterns through:
- **TodoWrite/TodoRead tools** for task planning and tracking
- **CLAUDE.md integration** for project-specific context
- **Real-time execution** with integrated planning

## Archived Content Summary

- **activeContext.md**: Historical progress tracking (now in CLAUDE.md)
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture patterns (key patterns migrated to CLAUDE.md)
- **techContext.md**: Technical setup (already covered in CLAUDE.md)
- **projectbrief.md**: Project overview (redundant with CLAUDE.md)
- **progress.md**: Status tracking (superseded by TodoWrite/TodoRead)

## Recommendations

1. Use Claude Code's TodoWrite/TodoRead for active task tracking
2. Refer to CLAUDE.md for project context and patterns
3. Archive this memory-bank directory as historical reference
4. Focus development through Claude Code's integrated plan-act approach
