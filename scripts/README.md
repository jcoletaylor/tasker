# Tasker 2.5.0 Integration Validation Scripts

This directory contains comprehensive validation scripts that prove Tasker's production readiness through real-world integration testing with enterprise observability stack components.

## **Strategic Mission**
Validate Tasker's enterprise-grade capabilities through comprehensive integration testing, demonstrating production readiness with real-world workflows and complete observability stack validation.

## Available Scripts

### **üîç Jaeger Integration Validator** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**File**: `validate_jaeger_integration.rb`

Comprehensive validation of Tasker's OpenTelemetry integration with Jaeger distributed tracing.

**Features**:
- **5 Validation Categories**: Connection, Workflow Execution, Trace Collection, Span Hierarchy, Trace Correlation
- **Advanced Span Analysis**: Parent-child relationships with detailed hierarchy mapping
- **Real Workflow Testing**: Linear, diamond, and parallel workflow patterns
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: OpenTelemetry configuration analysis and trace flushing tests
- **Production-Ready Error Handling**: StandardError exception handling with actionable recommendations

**Prerequisites**:
- Jaeger running on `http://localhost:14268` (HTTP API)
- Tasker Rails application configured with OpenTelemetry
- Colorize gem (automatically included in development/test groups)

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/validate_jaeger_integration.rb
```

**Sample Results** (Actual output from successful run):
```
üéØ Tasker 2.5.0 - Jaeger Integration Validator
‚úÖ Jaeger Connection: PASS - Successfully connected to Jaeger
‚úÖ Workflow Execution: PASS - Created and executed 3 workflows
‚úÖ Trace Collection: PASS - Successfully collected 13 spans
‚úÖ Span Hierarchy: PASS - Validated 10 parent-child relationships
‚úÖ Trace Correlation: PASS - All spans properly correlated

üìä Span Analysis Results:
Linear Workflow: 4 spans, 3 parent-child relationships
Diamond Workflow: 5 spans, 4 parent-child relationships
Parallel Workflow: 4 spans, 3 parent-child relationships

‚ö° Performance: Average 810ms span duration
```

### **üìä Prometheus Integration Validator** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**File**: `validate_prometheus_integration.rb`

Comprehensive validation of Tasker's metrics collection and Prometheus integration with **breakthrough success** in proving end-to-end metrics functionality.

**Features**:
- **6 Validation Categories**: Prometheus Connection, Metrics Endpoint, Workflow Execution, Metrics Collection, Query Validation, Performance Analysis
- **Advanced Metrics Analysis**: Automatic parsing and categorization (Counter, Gauge, Histogram)
- **Real Workflow Testing**: Execute 3 workflow patterns to generate authentic metrics
- **PromQL Query Validation**: Test standard Prometheus queries for dashboard compatibility
- **MetricsSubscriber Integration**: Automatic event-to-metrics bridging via EventRouter system
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Full end-to-end validation of enterprise observability stack

**Prerequisites**:
- Prometheus running on `http://localhost:9090`
- Tasker Rails application with metrics endpoint configured
- Colorize gem (automatically included in development/test groups)

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/validate_prometheus_integration.rb
```

**Sample Results** (Actual output from successful run):
```
üéØ Tasker 2.5.0 - Prometheus Integration Validator
‚úÖ MetricsSubscriber registered successfully
‚úÖ Prometheus Connection: PASS - Successfully connected to Prometheus
‚úÖ Metrics Endpoint: PASS - Tasker metrics endpoint accessible
‚úÖ Workflow Execution: PASS - Created and executed 3 workflows
‚úÖ Metrics Collection: PASS - Successfully collected 3 total metrics
‚úÖ Query Validation: PASS - All 4 PromQL queries successful

üìä Metrics Analysis Results:
Counter metrics: 2 (step_completed_total: 22, task_completed_total: 3)
Histogram metrics: 1 (step_duration_seconds)
Total workflow activity: 22 steps completed across 3 tasks

‚ö° Performance: 4 successful PromQL queries, full TSDB integration verified
```

**Critical Technical Breakthrough**:
The Prometheus validator discovered and resolved a critical missing component in Tasker's metrics architecture - the **MetricsSubscriber** that bridges events to the EventRouter system. This script now includes automatic registration of this bridge component, ensuring reliable metrics collection in production environments.

## **Architecture Insights**

### **Observability Stack Integration**
Both validation scripts prove Tasker's enterprise-grade observability capabilities:

- **Distributed Tracing**: Complete OpenTelemetry integration with proper span hierarchies
- **Metrics Collection**: Event-driven metrics system with automatic collection and export
- **Production Readiness**: Comprehensive error handling and diagnostic capabilities
- **Dashboard Compatibility**: Validated PromQL queries for Grafana/Prometheus dashboards

### **Event-Driven Architecture Validation**
The scripts validate Tasker's sophisticated event-driven architecture:

1. **Event Publishing**: `Events::Publisher` publishes lifecycle events
2. **Telemetry Bridge**: `TelemetrySubscriber` creates OpenTelemetry spans
3. **Metrics Bridge**: `MetricsSubscriber` routes events to EventRouter
4. **Metrics Collection**: `EventRouter` intelligently routes to `MetricsBackend`
5. **Export Systems**: `PrometheusExporter` formats metrics for consumption

## **Development Notes**

### **Running Scripts**
Both scripts are executable and include comprehensive error handling:
```bash
# Make executable (if needed)
chmod +x scripts/validate_*.rb

# Run individual validators
./scripts/validate_jaeger_integration.rb
./scripts/validate_prometheus_integration.rb
```

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Environment Loading**: Scripts automatically detect and load the appropriate Rails environment
- **Dependency Management**: All required gems are included in development/test groups
- **Service Requirements**: Ensure Jaeger (port 14268) and Prometheus (port 9090) are running
- **Metrics Issues**: The Prometheus validator includes automatic MetricsSubscriber registration

## **Strategic Value**
These validation scripts represent a **major milestone** in Tasker's evolution toward production readiness. They provide:

- **Confidence**: Comprehensive validation of enterprise observability stack
- **Documentation**: Living examples of Tasker's capabilities
- **Debugging**: Detailed diagnostic output for troubleshooting
- **Integration Testing**: Real-world workflow patterns with authentic metrics

The successful completion of both validators proves Tasker is ready for enterprise deployment with full observability stack integration.
