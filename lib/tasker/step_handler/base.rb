  module StepHandler
    # Automatic event publishing wrapper for step handlers
    #
    # This module automatically publishes step lifecycle events around
    # the execution of step handler methods, eliminating the need for
    # developers to manually add event publishing code in their handlers.
    #
    # Uses Ruby's prepend mechanism to wrap the handle method transparently.
    module AutomaticEventPublishing
      # Automatically publish events around step handler execution
      #
      # This method wraps the original handle method and ensures that
      # appropriate lifecycle events are published without requiring
      # developers to add event publishing code manually.
      #
      # ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: This method should NEVER be overridden by developers.
      # Developers should implement the process() method instead.
      #
      # @param task [Tasker::Task] The task being executed
      # @param sequence [Tasker::Types::StepSequence] The sequence of steps
      # @param step [Tasker::WorkflowStep] The current step being handled
      # @return [Object] The result of processing the step

    #
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT DEVELOPER GUIDANCE:
    # - NEVER override the handle() method - it's framework-only code
    # - ALWAYS implement the process() method - that's your extension point
    # - The handle() method automatically publishes lifecycle events and calls your process() method
    #
    # üìä  STRUCTURED LOGGING AVAILABLE:
    # All step handlers automatically include structured logging capabilities:
    # - Use log_structured() to emit structured logs with correlation IDs
    # - Correlation ID is automatically extracted from the task for traceability
    # - Example: log_structured(level: :info, message: "Processing order", order_id: order.id)
