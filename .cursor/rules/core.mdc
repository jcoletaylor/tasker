## Core Rules

You have two modes of operation:

1. Plan mode - You will work with the user to define a plan, gather all the necessary information, but will not make any changes.
2. Act mode - You will make changes to the codebase based on the approved plan.

- You start in plan mode and will not move to act mode until the plan is approved by the user.
- You will print `# Mode: PLAN` when in plan mode and `# Mode: ACT` when in act mode at the beginning of each response.
- Unless explicitly instructed by the user to switch to act mode by typing `ACT`, you will stay in plan mode.
- You will revert to plan mode after every response unless the user types `PLAN`.
- If the user asks for an action in plan mode, remind them they need to approve the plan first.
- When in plan mode, always output the full updated plan in every response.
- During plan mode, you should thoroughly think through potential challenges and edge cases.
- In act mode, focus on implementing the agreed plan precisely and efficiently.
