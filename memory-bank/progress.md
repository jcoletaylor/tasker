# Progress Tracking

## âœ… MAJOR MILESTONES COMPLETED

### Phase 1: TaskFinalizer Production Bug Resolution âœ… COMPLETE
**Status**: SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED - Critical production bug fixed and validated

- **Root Cause**: SQL execution context functions incorrectly treated retry-eligible failures as permanently blocked
- **Fix Applied**: Updated SQL functions to only count truly exhausted retries (`attempts >= retry_limit`) as blocked
- **Impact**: Tasks now properly stay in retry queue with exponential backoff instead of immediately failing
- **Validation**: All 24 production workflow tests passing across all workflow patterns

### Phase 2: Production System Safety Analysis âœ… COMPLETE
**Status**: SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED - No infinite loop risks identified

#### Production Coordinator Analysis âœ…
- **WorkflowCoordinator**: Clean loop termination with `break if viable_steps.empty?`
- **TaskReenqueuer**: Proper ActiveJob delegation without auto-processing
- **Main Coordinator**: System initialization only, no task processing loops
- **TaskFinalizer**: Event-driven finalization with proper reenqueuing delegation

#### Test Infrastructure Fixes âœ…
- **TestReenqueuer**: Removed auto-processing to prevent infinite recursion
- **TestCoordinator**: Added safety checks for tasks with no ready steps
- **Result**: Test suite runs in 5.01 seconds with 0 failures

### Phase 3: Intelligent Backoff Scheduling âœ… COMPLETE
**Status**: SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced DelayCalculator with step-aware timing

#### Problem Identification âœ…
- **Issue**: Static delays didn't consider actual step backoff timing
- **Impact**: Tasks reenqueued immediately even when steps had long backoff periods
- **Inefficiency**: Unnecessary processing cycles for tasks not ready for retry

#### Solution Implementation âœ…
- **Enhanced DelayCalculator**: Calculates optimal delays based on step backoff timing
- **Key Algorithm**: Finds step with longest remaining backoff time
- **Smart Scheduling**: Tasks reenqueued when steps become ready for retry
- **Safety Features**: 30-minute cap, 5-second buffer, handles both explicit and exponential backoff

#### Validation Results âœ…
- **Single Step Test**: 120s backoff â†’ 124s delay (120s + 5s buffer) âœ…
- **Multiple Steps Test**: Takes longest backoff (180s â†’ 184s delay) âœ…
- **Fallback Test**: Uses standard delays when no backoff needed âœ…
- **All 27 production workflow tests passing** âœ…
