- **Production Deployment**: Comprehensive operational guides

### Phase 3: Community Building (Following Month)
- **Community Examples**: User-contributed workflow patterns
- **Integration Showcases**: Popular gem integrations and patterns
- **Advanced Use Cases**: Complex real-world scenarios
- **Video Content**: Screencasts and tutorials

## Current Priorities

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Example Validation Framework**: Design and implement testing structure
2. **Blog Infrastructure**: Set up GitBook integration and publishing workflow
3. **Core Example Development**: Begin e-commerce workflow blog post

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **First Blog Post**: Complete e-commerce example with full validation
2. **CI Integration**: Automated testing of all example code
3. **Developer Feedback**: Initial user testing of blog content

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Blog Series Expansion**: 5-7 comprehensive blog posts
2. **Advanced Examples**: Complex workflow patterns and integrations
3. **Community Engagement**: Developer feedback and iteration

## Success Metrics

### Technical Quality Metrics
- **Example Validation**: 100% of blog examples pass automated tests *(Target)*
- **Test Coverage**: All documentation code samples under test *(Target)*
- **Integration Success**: Examples work with common Rails patterns *(Target)*

### Developer Adoption Metrics
- **Time to First Workflow**: <5 minutes from installation *(Current: ~5 minutes)*
- **Documentation Completeness**: Zero gaps in developer journey *(Target)*
- **Community Response**: Positive feedback on blog series *(Target)*

### Production Readiness Metrics

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

### 1. Example-First Documentation Strategy
**Decision**: Focus on validated, working examples rather than theoretical documentation
**Rationale**: Developers need confidence that examples will work in their applications

### 2. Narrative Blog Series Approach
**Decision**: Tell stories with context rather than isolated tutorials
**Rationale**: Helps developers understand when and why to use specific patterns

### 3. Production-Ready Examples
**Decision**: All examples designed for actual production use
**Rationale**: Bridges the gap between tutorials and real-world implementation

### 4. Comprehensive Validation
**Decision**: Test every code sample in documentation
**Rationale**: Ensures examples stay current with evolving codebase

## Lessons Learned

### From Production Release
- **Schema Flattening**: Dramatically simplifies new user onboarding
- **Gem Naming**: Important to research name availability early
- **Version Reset**: Clean versioning helps establish public release credibility

### From Architecture Development
