# Project Brief: Tasker Engine - Example Validation & Developer Adoption Phase

## Project Overview
**Tasker Engine** is a mature, production-ready Rails engine for enterprise-grade workflow orchestration that has successfully transitioned from internal development to **public release**. We are now in the **Example Validation & Developer Adoption** phase, focused on ensuring comprehensive, tested examples and documentation to drive developer adoption.

## Current Status: Production-Ready Public Release
- **Version**: 1.0.0 (public release - reset from internal v2.7.0)
- **Gem Name**: `tasker-engine` (renamed from `tasker` due to RubyGems collision)
- **Release Status**: Published to RubyGems and GitHub Packages
- **Branch**: `blog-example-validation` - focused on validating blog examples and code samples

## Mission Statement
Transform complex, multi-step workflows into reliable, observable processes for Ruby on Rails applications, while providing comprehensive, validated examples and documentation that enable rapid developer adoption.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Complex Workflow Patterns**: Linear, diamond, tree, and parallel merge workflows
- **Production Resilience**: Automatic failure recovery with intelligent retry orchestration
- **Complete Observability**: 56 built-in events with comprehensive telemetry
- **Enterprise Security**: Authentication & authorization with GraphQL operation-level permissions
- **High Performance**: SQL-function based orchestration with 2-5ms execution times
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive generators, YARD docs, and validated examples

## Current Phase: Example Validation & Developer Adoption
**Goal**: Build comprehensive blog series and documentation ecosystem to help developers adopt Tasker Engine effectively.

**Key Components**:
- **GitBook Documentation**: Local at `/Users/petetaylor/projects/tasker-blog`, published at https://docs.tasker.systems
- **Blog Series**: Narrative-driven examples showing production usage patterns
- **Example Validation**: Testing framework to ensure all blog examples and code samples work in practice
- **Developer Experience**: Focus on practical, working examples rather than core engine development

## Architecture Maturity
- **1,692+ Tests Passing**: Complete infrastructure with zero tolerance for failures
- **Thread-Safe Registries**: Enterprise-grade registry systems with structured logging
- **Intelligent Caching**: Distributed coordination with adaptive TTL calculation
- **SQL Functions**: High-performance PostgreSQL functions for orchestration
- **Event System**: Comprehensive event-driven architecture with 56 built-in events
- **State Machines**: Robust task and step state management via Statesman

## Success Metrics
- **Technical Excellence**: 1,692+ passing tests, enterprise-grade reliability
- **Developer Adoption**: Comprehensive examples, generators, and documentation
- **Production Readiness**: Battle-tested retry logic, observability, and security
- **Community Growth**: Public gem availability and validated learning resources
