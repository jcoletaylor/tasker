# Product Context: Enterprise Workflow Orchestration Engine

## The Problem Tasker Engine Solves

### Complex Workflow Orchestration Challenges
Modern applications need to coordinate complex, multi-step processes that involve:
- **Multiple Dependencies**: Steps that depend on completion of other steps
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Observability**: Complete visibility into workflow progress and failures
- **Concurrency**: Parallel execution of independent steps
- **State Management**: Reliable tracking of workflow and step states
- **Enterprise Security**: Authentication and authorization for workflow operations

### Before Tasker Engine
Developers typically faced these painful alternatives:
1. **Manual State Management**: Hand-coding state machines and dependency logic
2. **Background Job Chains**: Complex chains of jobs with brittle error handling
3. **External Workflow Engines**: Heavy, complex systems requiring separate infrastructure
4. **Custom Solutions**: Reinventing workflow orchestration for each project

## How Tasker Engine Works

### Core Architecture
Tasker Engine provides a **Rails-native solution** that transforms complex processes into reliable workflows:

```ruby
# Define workflow in YAML
name: process_order
namespace_name: ecommerce
version: 1.0.0
step_templates:
  - name: validate_order
    handler_class: Ecommerce::ValidateOrderHandler
  - name: process_payment
    depends_on_step: validate_order
    handler_class: Ecommerce::ProcessPaymentHandler
    default_retryable: true
  - name: send_confirmation
    depends_on_step: process_payment
    handler_class: Ecommerce::SendConfirmationHandler
```

```ruby
# Implement business logic in Ruby
class Ecommerce::ValidateOrderHandler < Tasker::StepHandler::Base
  def process(task, sequence, step)
    order = Order.find(task.context['order_id'])
    raise "Invalid order" unless order.valid?
    { order: order.as_json, validated: true }
  end
end
```

### Key Benefits

#### 1. **Declarative Configuration**
- YAML-based step templates with dependency declarations
- Ruby classes for business logic implementation
- Clear separation of workflow structure and implementation

#### 2. **Intelligent Execution**
- Automatic dependency resolution and parallel execution
- Dynamic concurrency based on system health metrics
- SQL-function based orchestration for 2-5ms performance

#### 3. **Production-Grade Reliability**
- Exponential backoff retry logic with configurable limits
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- State machine-based status management via Statesman

#### 4. **Complete Observability**
- 56 built-in events covering entire workflow lifecycle
- OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

#### 5. **Enterprise Security**
- Pluggable authentication strategies (JWT, Devise, custom)
- Resource-based authorization with coordinator pattern
- Automatic GraphQL operation-to-permission mapping

## Target Use Cases

### Perfect For
- **E-commerce Order Processing**: Validate → Payment → Inventory → Fulfillment → Notification
- **Customer Onboarding**: Registration → Verification → Profile Setup → Welcome Sequence
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Extract → Transform → Validate → Load → Notify
- **Integration Workflows**: API Calls → Data Sync → Validation → Error Handling
- **Financial Processing**: Authorization → Settlement → Reconciliation → Reporting

### When to Use Tasker Engine
- **Multi-step processes** with dependencies between steps
- **Reliability requirements** needing automatic retries and error recovery
- **Observability needs** requiring visibility into workflow progress
- **Scalability requirements** needing concurrent step execution
- **Enterprise environments** requiring security and audit trails
